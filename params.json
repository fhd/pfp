  "body": "[Easy Passwords](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/easy-passwords/) is a Firefox extension that allows generating secure site-specific passwords for all websites from a single master password. It keeps track of the parameters used to generate these passwords, but the passwords themselves are never stored. You can always generate them again if you have the master password, but without the master password the data stored by this extension is useless.\r\n\r\nLegacy passwords that you cannot change can also be stored securely in this extension, these will be encrypted using your master password and cannot be decrypted without knowing the master password.\r\n\r\nIf you need to generate one of your passwords and cannot use Easy Passwords, there is an [online version](https://palant.de/easypasswords-online.html) available. Please make sure to read the warnings when using this one!\r\n\r\nInstalling build prerequisites\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn order to build EasyPasswords you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) first. You will also need [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), run the following command to install it (administrator privileges required):\r\n\r\n    npm install --global gulp-cli\r\n\r\nAdditional dependencies are installed using the following command in the extension directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\nHow to build\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIf all the dependencies are installed building EasyPasswords is simply a matter of running Gulp:\r\n\r\n    gulp xpi\r\n\r\nThis will create a package inside the `build-jpm` directory with the file name like `easypasswords@palant.de-n.n.n.xpi` that you can install in Firefox.\r\n\r\nHow to test\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nTesting your changes is easiest if you install the [Extension Auto-Installer extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/autoinstaller/). Then you can push the current repository state to your browser using the following command:\r\n\r\n    gulp post\r\n\r\nThis will install Easy Passwords in your browser automatically, without any prompts or browser restarts. If you changed the port that Extension Auto-Installer is listening to you will have to specify it on the command line:\r\n\r\n    gulp post --post-url=7777\r\n\r\nIf you want to test on another computer you can specify a host as well:\r\n\r\n    gulp post --post-url=device.localdomain:8888\r\n\r\nYou can also make Gulp watch the repository for changes and reinstall Easy Passwords whenever some file changes:\r\n\r\n    gulp watch\r\n\r\nHere you can use the same `--post-url` parameter as with `gulp post`.\r\n\r\nCleaning up the repository\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can run the following command to remove all temporary files that have been generated during build:\r\n\r\n    gulp clean\r\n",
